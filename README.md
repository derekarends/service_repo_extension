# service_repo_extension
Visual Studio extension to create the boiler plate classes for a service/repo architecture.
To use this extension it will need to be installed and then it should be found in the TOOLS dropdown.  The project you want these files to be added to will need to be selected before it is available for selection.  If you select both the service and the repository to be created the service class will inject the repository via constructor injection.
